## Student Information
- **Project Name**: QuizMaster
- **Description**: Full-stack interactive quiz application with user authentication and real-time statistics
- **Technology Stack**: React + TypeScript + Express.js + PostgreSQL

## Project Overview

QuizMaster is a comprehensive quiz application that provides:
- User authentication and session management
- Categorized quizzes with multiple difficulty levels
- Real-time statistics and progress tracking
- Multilingual support (English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese)
- Responsive design with dark/light theme support

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Wouter** for client-side routing
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **Radix UI** components with **shadcn/ui** styling
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design

### Backend
- **Express.js** with TypeScript
- **PostgreSQL** database with **Drizzle ORM**
- **Session-based authentication** with bcryptjs password hashing
- **Neon Database** for cloud PostgreSQL hosting

### Key Features
1. **Authentication System**: Secure login/registration with session management
2. **Quiz Engine**: Dynamic question loading with timed sessions
3. **Statistics Dashboard**: Real-time performance tracking
4. **Responsive UI**: Mobile-first design with accessibility features
5. **Multilingual Support**: Internationalization for global users

## Database Schema

The application uses a relational PostgreSQL schema with:
- **Users**: Authentication and profile management
- **Categories**: Quiz subject categories with metadata
- **Questions**: Multiple-choice questions with explanations
- **Quiz Sessions**: Complete quiz attempts with scoring
- **User Activities**: Activity logging for engagement tracking
- **User Stats**: Aggregated performance statistics

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL 16+
- npm or yarn

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (DATABASE_URL)
4. Run database migrations: `npm run db:push`
5. Start development server: `npm run dev`

### Production Build
1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Start production server: `npm start`

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user

### Quiz Management
- `GET /api/categories` - Get all quiz categories
- `GET /api/questions/:categoryId` - Get questions by category
- `POST /api/quiz/submit` - Submit quiz answers
- `GET /api/quiz/history` - Get user's quiz history

### Statistics
- `GET /api/stats/user` - Get user statistics
- `GET /api/activities` - Get user activities

## Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs for secure password storage
- **Session Management**: HTTP-only cookies with PostgreSQL session store
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for API request validation
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware for authenticated endpoints
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup

## Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Vite-based bundle optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Dynamic imports for route components
- **Caching**: TanStack Query for intelligent data caching
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries with proper indexes

## Testing Strategy

The application includes:
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Runtime validation with Zod schemas
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Input sanitization and validation

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on:
- **Replit**: Full-stack deployment with automatic scaling
- **Vercel/Netlify**: Frontend deployment with serverless functions
- **Railway/Render**: Full-stack deployment with PostgreSQL

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:
- Real-time multiplayer quizzes
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Question creation interface for teachers
- Mobile application development
- AI-powered question generation

## Technical Decisions

### Why React + TypeScript?
- Type safety reduces runtime errors
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Excellent developer experience with modern tooling

### Why Express.js?
- Mature and stable framework
- Extensive middleware ecosystem
- Easy integration with PostgreSQL

### Why PostgreSQL?
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Advanced querying capabilities
- Excellent performance for complex relationships

### Why Session-based Auth?
- Simpler implementation than JWT
- Better security for web applications
- Automatic session cleanup
